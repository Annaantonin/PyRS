*Note: If document form is used, one document could/should hold a
complete set of user stories, not just one.*

*Note: **Remove** the blue text when ready to use the template.*

User Story Title: \<*title*\>
=============================

*Note: The story is the statemen below would be the part that would go
on a sticky note is using them. However, it is important to capture
these other attributes for tracking purposes:*

-   ***ID** -- Some unique ID*

-   ***Complexity** -- Complexity points (sometimes called story points)
    are a metric that identifies the difficulty or value of the story.
    It should not be number of estimated hours!*

-   ***Est**. -- Estimate is a projection of hours. It is highly
    discouraged to not use this. I put this here as a place holder but
    would like to remove it! Save the hour estimates for the tasks
    associated with the story*

-   ***Author** -- The person who wrote the initial story*


| **ID** | **Complexity** |  **Est.** |  **Author** |
| ------ | ---------------|-----------|-------------|
| id1 | compl1 | Est1 | auth1 |
                                       

As a \<*role or type of user*\> I want to \< *take some action or
achieve some goal*\> so that \<*some reason, e.g. I get this benefit*\>

Acceptance Criteria:
--------------------

*Note: The Acceptance Criteria specify how the use story will be
evaluated and determined to have been implemented successfully --
"done". This is often done by listing a set of steps or actions and the
expected result of those actions.*

When I \<*take this action*\>, this happens \<*description of result*\>

Description, Additional Detail, Context
---------------------------------------

*Note: Capture any useful information that provides additional detail or
context for the simple user story statement. Also, any qualifying
statements (supplemental requirements) such as formulas, performance,
scalability, etc.*

Python Residual Stress analysis
---------------------------------

pyRS is a Python software framework for the reduction, analysis and visualization neutron diffraction data for residual stress analysis.
The pyRS software is tailored to meet the needs of the `High Intensity Diffractometer for Residual stress Analysis <https://neutrons.ornl.gov/nrsf2>`_ instrument at the `High Flux Isotope Reactor <https://neutrons.ornl.gov/hfir>`_.
pyRS relies on the scientific stack composed of [NumPy]_, [SciPy]_, [Matplotlib]_, and [mantid]_.
pyRS is part of the Oak Ridge `Neutrons Scattering Software suite <https://github.com/neutrons>`_.
Funded by the `Office of Energy Science <https://www.energy.gov/science/bes/basic-energy-sciences>`_, U.S. Department of Energy

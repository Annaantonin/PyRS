Python Residual Stress analysis
---------------------------------

pyRS is a Python software framework for the reduction, analysis and visualization neutron diffraction data for residual stress analysis.
The pyRS software is tailored to meet the needs of the High Intensity Diffractometer for Residual stress Analysis instrument at the High Flux Isotope Reactor.
pyRS relies on the scientific stack composed of [NumPy]_, [SciPy]_, [Matplotlib]_, and [mantid]_/
pyRS is part of the Oak Ridge `Neutrons Scattering Software suite <https://github.com/neutrons>`_.
Funded by the `Office of Energy Science <https://www.energy.gov/science/bes/basic-energy-sciences>`_, U.S. Department of Energy
